## How It Works

1. You authorize Tinymind to read/write your public GitHub repositories.
2. Tinymind immediately creates a public repository named `tinymind-blog` in your GitHub account.
3. When you write anything on Tinymind, it automatically commits to your `yourname/tinymind-blog` repository.

Your data is stored on your GitHub repository, separate from Tinymind.
